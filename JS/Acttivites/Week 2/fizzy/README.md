# Fizzy

### Introduction

[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz): A well-known programming challenge is designed to evaluate your problem-solving approach with a straightforward task. Today, we'll tackle a simplified version of that task, without using loops for now. We'll focus on a basic single-number FizzBuzz problem, which is a great way to test our ability to use conditional branching. The interesting part is that there are numerous ways to solve this problem, so which approach will you choose?

### Tools Used

You'll get practice with the following:

- Full-featured functions (parameters and return values).
- `if-else` statements.
- Modulus operations.

### Setup

You'll only write one function this time, but there are various inputs you'll need to handle, so this is a test-driven exercise.

- Copy, create, and navigate to this repo.
- In a terminal (preferably a full-screen one), run `npm test`.
- Code away until the results are all green.
