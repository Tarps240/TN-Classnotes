# Portfolio Project

## Your Task

Welcome to your first project! You'll be creating a web application from scratch. This week, your task is to build a portfolio page, which you can continue to develop and enhance as the course progresses.

A well-crafted portfolio can showcase your skills and talents to potential employers, whether they are looking for part-time or full-time candidates. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work and demonstrates the thought processes behind it. Students with portfolios featuring deployed web applications (i.e., live on the web) tend to be very successful in their job searches post-bootcamp. It's important to note that having several deployed projects is often a minimum requirement to secure initial interviews with many companies.

With these points in mind, this homework will set you up for future success by applying core skills you’ve recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. You'll practice your new skills while creating a portfolio that will be invaluable during your job search. It’s a win-win that you'll likely appreciate in the future!

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can update them with real applications as you create them later in the course.

## User Story

`AS AN employer`

`I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples`

`SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position`

## Acceptance Criteria

To develop a portfolio that meets the needs of a typical hiring manager, the following criteria must be satisfied:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
