In this tutorial, we'll guide you through recreating a simple responsive webpage using Bootstrap. Follow the steps below to build your own webpage similar to the example provided.

## Step 1: Setup

* Open your preferred text editor or IDE.
* Create a new HTML file and name it index.html.
* Set up the basic structure of an HTML document, including the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
## Step 2: Link Bootstrap

* Go to the Bootstrap website and copy the CDN links for Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript.
* Paste these links into the <head> section of your HTML document to link the Bootstrap stylesheet and JavaScript files.

## Step 3: Header

* Create a header section using the <header> tag.
* Add a heading element (<h1>) with the text "Welcome to My Website".
* Apply Bootstrap classes to style the header, such as bg-dark, text-white, text-center, and py-4.

## Step 4: Navigation Bar

* Create a navigation bar using the <nav> and <ul> tags.
* Inside the <ul> tag, create list items (<li>) for each navigation link (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).
* Apply Bootstrap classes to style the navigation bar, such as navbar, navbar-expand-lg, navbar-dark, and bg-primary.

## Step 5: Main Content

* Use the Bootstrap grid system to create a two-column layout for the main content.
* Inside each column, add content such as headings, paragraphs, and lists.
* Apply Bootstrap classes to style the content and adjust the layout based on screen size (e.g., col-md-6 for medium-sized screens).

## Step 6: Footer

* Create a footer section using the <footer> tag.
* Add a copyright message with the text "Â© 2024 My Website. All rights reserved."
* Apply Bootstrap classes to style the footer, such as bg-dark, text-white, text-center, and py-4.

## Step 7: Test and Customize

* Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to preview the webpage.
Test the responsiveness by resizing the browser window or viewing the webpage on different devices.
* Customize the content, colors, and styles to match your preferences or the requirements of your project.
