# Basic HTML text marking guide

The aim of these tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of the HTML text fundamentals

## Task 1

This task covers understanding of HTML headings and paragraphs.

It doesn't make sense for the subheadings to be a higher level than the top-level heading, or for the paragraphs to be marked up with something other than `<p>`.

## Task 2

In task 2 you need to wrap the first list in a `<ul>` element, and the second list in a `<ol>`. The individual list items for both lists need to be wrapped in `<li>` elements.

## Task 3

The last task aims to test understanding of using basic inline elements such as `<strong>` and `<em>`. Simply, you need to markup a couple of words appropriately using each one.
