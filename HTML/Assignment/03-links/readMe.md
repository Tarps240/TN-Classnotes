# Links marking guide

The aim of the tasks is to demonstrate an understanding of hyperlinks.

## Task 1

The first task covers some link basics â€” setting a link destination, giving it a descriptive title, and creating an email link.

The title needs to contain some supplemental information about the page that is useful but not essential for knowing what the linked page is about. If the subject was included on the email link, it really needs `%20` escape characters included so that you get spaces in the subject line. 

## Task 2

Our second task here tests your knowledge of  absolute and relative paths, as well as link fragments. 

## Task 3

Our final task in this set is concerned with good practices for link text.

Basically, all three paragraphs need to be rewritten with good link text, and the third one needs to have a warning added to the link to say that it is a large download.
